That is not an honest conflict of interest statement... political affiliations need to be recognised. Woroni editors should not be allowed to edit out their affiliations in order to make their articles appear unbiased.

While Our ANU Sport may not claim to have political affiliations as a ticket, the members of the team quoted in this article have very well known political links that are also held by at least one of the authors of the article. This is all the more important considering that this is not a balanced article.

I''m really disappointed Woroni. Pick up your game.
